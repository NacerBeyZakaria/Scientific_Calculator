1. **Download the latest release** from the “Releases” section on GitHub.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file to start the calculator (no installation required).
3. Use standard math syntax:  
   - `sin(pi/2)`, `ln(10)`, `log(100)`, `exp(3)`, `sqrt(25)`, etc.
   - Use the sidebar for advanced math (derivative, integral), graphing, or conversions.
   - Press `ans` to reuse your previous result.
